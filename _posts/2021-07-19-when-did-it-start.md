I started learning Japanese in exactly 11.23.2020.  Just kept writing and writing characters until 12.06.2020. The characters were foreign to my hand so I wanted to get used to writing them before even start learning words.

Then I bought Genki 1 and started the lesson 1.

At the same time I started searching about methods/ideas on learning languages and stuff.

Then found out about the newer methods of language learning which involves being exposed to language as practically as possible.

Naturally, the absolute best way is being in a country that literally speaks the language. But I was (and am) in the middle of a ~pandemic~.

So I found the next best thing with my case being Japanese language: Anime.

At the same time I found the “80/20 Japanese” book which I absolutely love over Genki.

I read a few lessons of 80/20.

At the same time I was adding new words to my Anki deck daily. I added around 10 words each day.

I watched ~2500 anime episodes in ~4 months (Avg 20.3 episodes daily).

Then life happened and I got burnt out and had to pause most of my projects around two months ago.

But I’ve picked Japanese up again a few days ago.

So here we go.
