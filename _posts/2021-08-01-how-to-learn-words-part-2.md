In this part, we’ll talk about out of context learning. They are the words you find in lists, flash cards, etc. Not the words you hear or see in books, movies, etc.

I use them to build a base vocabulary knowledge so I’ll be able to learn newer words easier as I watch or read stuff.

I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Anki is a free flashcard application. It’s on web, Android, IOS, Windows, etc.

Anki uses [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to help you remember words.

Basically, you don’t review every flashcard every single day.

You give feedbacks for each word as you review them. (like it’s easy, hard, etc.) Based on the feedback, the app decides when to ask you that card again.

Each time you remember a word, the app asks you that card again, in a longer span of time than before next time.

The cards that you have to practice each day consist of:
- New words
- Older words that need review

As you start practicing, it also makes a list of words that you need to repeat practicing in that same session based on your feedback.

You can either make your own list of cards (aka “deck”) or you can use the decks other have made and shared from this address: [https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)
