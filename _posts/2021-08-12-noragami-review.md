### Brief Review: (*w/ minor spoilers*)

Noragami is a hilarious anime with funny characters packed with action scenes and cool music. A solid 8.5/10 shounen anime.

The concept is about a "stray god" with low ranking amongst the other gods. He doesn't even have a shrine (which shows the popularity and status of a God.) People call him on phone and pay the fee of 5 yen coin and ask him to handle their errand/prayer. But his life changes as he meets two people: a living human that doesn't forget him, unlike other humans. She's named Hiyori. And a dead teenager who becomes his "divine instrument", a tool that Gods use to eliminate phantoms (the invisible creatures harmful to the living world) He's named Yukine.

The fact that Yato is low-ranking and has a miserable life (in a comedic way) makes you care about him more.

Hiyori the human is the savior of Yato the God and a source of motivation for him in various occasions. She does things that normal humans wouldn't do just because how much she cares for Yato and Yukine. She's almost the most unusual element in the world of this story and makes the events interesting.

Overall, Noragami is definitely worth watching. Two seasons is out and it may continue too.

### Additional thoughts (*w/ spoilers*)

Obviously, it's a shounen manga/anime, it doesn't have to completely logically make sense. But I think the god characters, have more of a "angel" functionality than a "god." The name of "god" might just be a cooler term to use. The fact that a God can die and regenerate or completely vanish if they're not remembered by any being in the living relm implies that there is a higher power than these gods. Their higher power must be immune to life and death.
