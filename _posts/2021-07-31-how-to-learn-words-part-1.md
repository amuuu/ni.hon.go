Basically, there are two ways we can encounter new words:
- In the context: You/hear see a word in a book or movie
- Out of context: You actively find words in lists/flash cards/etc.

Obviously, the best way is to learn words in their context. BUT there are two problems:
1) only sticking to this way might take a long time.
2) you need a base vocabulary knowledge to be able to contextualize the content and learn new words

So we need out-of-context learning to help us accelerate the in-context learning.

Out-of-context learning can be not completely out of context. You can obviously use example sentences and other things to make it as easy to remember as possible.

How to study words out of context properly?

Weâ€™ll talk about that in the next part!
