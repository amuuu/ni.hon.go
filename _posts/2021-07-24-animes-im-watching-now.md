## 1) Mushishi
- One of my favorite animes ever (although I haven’t finished it yet)
- Fantasy, based on east Asian folklore and stories
- It’s like a wise person is kindly telling you a story

## 2) Monster
- Crime/Psychology/Mystery/Drama
- Thrilling story, about a doctor’s pursuit of a murderer and many things that happen to him and other characters along the way
- Classic anime

## 3)  Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch
- Not cool art style (imo). But amazing story. I’m SURE it has a lot of plot twists.
- Smart as hell main character. Reminds you of Light/L in Death Note

## 4) Bakuman
- I mean, it is anime. And it is fiction.
- Main char is trying to become mangaka to fulfill his dream and finally get together with the “love” that he promised not to speak with until he makes an anime.
- It’s better than it sounds tho
