“Path to least resistance” is a scientific principle, however it can be used to help build habits. 

Basically, you make the situations / environment so simple and so easy to follow that you can’t even procrastinate or find other things to do.

For example, if you want to make the habit of reading books here’s what you can do:

- Put the book in your sight all day so you won’t forget about it and it’s easy to access.
- Start by promising yourself to only read 2 minutes a day. 

How did I use it in the context of learning Japanese?

Context: I use Anki to learn vocabulary which is a free virtual flash card tool that helps you learn things using a method called “[Spaced Repetition Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)”

I used to add new words to my words deck/collection daily. It was a lot of effort since I had to scavenge the internet or books or vocab lists to collect new words.

Eventually I got tired of it and I found myself skipping days and didn’t add new words.

Then I decided to make the process of learning words as easy as it can get.

So I searched for a bunch of premade word collections for Anki and got some collections with a couple of thousands of words that will be enough supply for a 2-3 years.

Another thing that can be done if you’re just beginning, is that you can start by learning 5 new words per day. Then increase the number every few days/weeks.
