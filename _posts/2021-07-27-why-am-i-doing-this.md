I ask that question daily about my life in general :)))) But about learning Japanese, let’s talk about it.

I started it because I just wanted to do something that I never thought I would do. It happened in a second. Then I ordered a book to hit the nail more in the wall immediately. (It was 3 A.M.) and immediately started writing letters the next morning.  

It was more of a drunken decision except I was not drunk. (???)

Now it’s just a fun thing to do. And also a challenge to keep doing something just because and try to not find excuses to quit a daily routine.  Also I want to exercise my brain. Guess I have many reasons for it huh? 

I don’t have plans to take JPLT tests. Or like moving to Japan for work or study or anything. 
Maybe some of them will change in the future?
